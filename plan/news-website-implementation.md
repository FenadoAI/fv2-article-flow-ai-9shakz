### Backend APIs (FastAPI)

    "content": str,
    "summary": str,  # AI-generated
    "category": str,
    "author": str,
    "created_at": datetime,
    "updated_at": datetime,
    "views": int,
    "shares": int,
    "published": bool
}

categories = {
    "_id": ObjectId,
    "name": str,
    "slug": str,
    "description": str,
    "created_at": datetime
}
```

#### 2. API Endpoints
